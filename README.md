## 4. Section: Call to Action

### Features:

- **Dynamic Frames and Imagery:**
  - As the user scrolls, frames containing images of flowers and trees animate into view with a combination of opacity transitions, scaling effects, and subtle movement.
  - Images include:
    - Flower 1: Positioned with a slight upward diagonal motion.
    - Flower 2: Moves diagonally downward for dynamic symmetry.
    - Tree 1 and Tree 2: Introduce depth by animating along opposing axes.

- **Scroll-triggered Animation:**
  - Animations triggered when the user reaches the "garden" section, offering a seamless and visually engaging experience.
  - Images grow and fade into view, creating the sense of an evolving, interactive garden.

- **Parallax Idea:**
  - A barren screen gradually transforms into a thriving garden as the user scrolls.
  - Flowers and trees "grow" into view, creating a visually rewarding experience.

- **Encouraging Text:**
  - Bold messages encourage participation:
    - *"Be part of the Bloom."*
    - *"Start your growth journey today."*
